Dynamically changes pen tip binding activation and deactivation points.

## Disclaimer:

### Rapid Trigger has a **very high** potential to trip anti-cheats in some games when using low activation and deactivation sensitivity. It may also be against the rules regardless of sensitivity in many cases. Use this plugin at your own risk.

## Rapid Trigger:

**Pressure Activation Threshold:** The raw pen pressure value where the pen tip binding is activated, regardless of the **Activation Sensitivity** or **Deactivation Sensitivity**.

**Pressure Deactivation Threshold:** The raw pen pressure value where the pen tip binding is deactivated, regardless of the **Activation Sensitivity** or **Deactivation Sensitivity**.

**Activation Sensitivity:** The raw pen pressure delta to activate the pen tip binding while the pen tip binding is deactivated.

**Deactivation Sensitivity:** The raw pen pressure delta to deactivate the pen tip binding while the pen tip binding is activated.
